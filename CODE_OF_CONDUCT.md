# Grokness Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

    -   Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
    -   Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
    -   Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
    -   Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
    -   Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

    -   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
    -   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
    -   Public or private harassment.
    -   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
    -   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Prohibited Plugins and Contributions

To maintain the integrity, safety, and ethical standards of the Grokness project and the grok.com platform, certain types of plugins and contributions are strictly prohibited. These include, but are not limited to:

    -   Exploits and Vulnerabilities: Any code that exploits security vulnerabilities in grok.com, its APIs, or related services, such as unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or injection attacks.
    -   Harmful Modifications: Plugins that disrupt site functionality, degrade user experience for others, or introduce malware, viruses, spyware, or any form of harmful software.
    -   Terms of Service Violations: Content that violates grok.com's terms of service, including automated scraping, spamming, impersonation, or unauthorized data collection/manipulation.
    -   Ethical Violations: Plugins promoting hate speech, discrimination, illegal activities, or any form of harm to individuals, groups, or the platform itself.
    -   Performance-Degrading Code: Intentional resource hogs, infinite loops, or code that could cause denial-of-service-like effects on the site or users' browsers.

Submitting or distributing prohibited plugins may result in immediate removal from the project, bans from repositories, and potential reporting to relevant authorities if illegal activity is involved. We prioritize the safety and well-being of the community and the host platform.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and when an individual officially represents the community in public spaces. Examples include posting via an official social media account or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via our Discord server. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
